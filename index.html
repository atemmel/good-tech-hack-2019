		<h1>Hi there, my name is JanuCommunity.</h1>
		Ooh
		You can dance
		You can jive
		Having the time of your life
		Ooh, see that girl
		Watch that scene
		Dig in the dancing queen
		Friday night and the lights are low
		Looking out for a place to go
		Where they play the right music
		Getting in the swing
		You come to look for a king
		Anybody could be that guy
		Night is young and the music's high
		With a bit of rock music
		Everything is fine
		You're in the mood for a dance
		And when you get the chance
		You are the dancing queen
		Young and sweet
		Only seventeen
		Dancing queen
		Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
		You can dance
		You can jive
		Having the time of your life
		Ooh, see that girl
		Watch that scene
		Dig in the dancing queen
		You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
		Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
		Looking out for another
		Anyone will do
		You're in the mood for a dance
		And when you get the chance
		You are the dancing queen
		Young and sweet
		Only seventeen
		Dancing queen
		Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
		You can dance
		You can jive
		Having the time of your life
		Ooh, see that girl
		Watch that scene
		Dig in the dancing queen
		Dig in the dancing queen
